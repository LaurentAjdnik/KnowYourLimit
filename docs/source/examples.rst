Simple estimate for d-regular graphs
-------------------------------------
In this example we will show how to generate a simple estimate for the output energy of 3 layers of noisy QAOA for the Ising model on a random d-regular graph.

We will assume that the device's topology is square.
We will then compare the output's enmergy
